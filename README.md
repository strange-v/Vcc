# Vcc
Arduino library for AVR microcontrollers that allows measuring supply voltage without external components and additional wairing.

## Disclaimer
There are no examples yet, I'll add them soon.

This library is almost fully based on [Scott Daniels'](https://provideyourown.com/2012/secret-arduino-voltmeter-measure-battery-voltage/) work.
